## sub.sample command in mothur 1.39.5 got bug and error, so need to change to new version.
Anaconda source only available for 1.39.5 being the updated version

**Navigate to (mothur release web)[https://github.com/mothur/mothur/releases] and download 
``Mothur.linux_64.zip`` using wget to my home directory in Staton server
