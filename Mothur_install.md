### Install mothur 1.40.5

sub.sample command in mothur 1.39.5 got bug and error, so need to change to new version.
Anaconda source only available for 1.39.5 being the updated version

1. Navigate to (mothur release web)[https://github.com/mothur/mothur/releases]

2. Download 
``Mothur.linux_64.zip`` using wget to my home directory in Staton server
3. unzip the compressed file 
4. run mothur command inside of mothur folder. ``/localhome/fliu21/mothur/mothur``
5. To make it easier runing by just typing in mothur, I copied this mothur command into ``/localhome/fliu21/anaconda3/bin``
6. Just type in mothur will active the mothur environment wherever the folder I am in.
