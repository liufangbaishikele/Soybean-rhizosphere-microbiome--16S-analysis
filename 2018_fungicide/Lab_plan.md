## DNA extraction plan for fungicide project

**Questions to ask Sarah**

* Do you think the kit will still be usable after expired for 1 month? Can I do a test do you think? Do you have V3_V4 primer for this testing? 

* As you will be out of town, whom could ask for help in terms of the instrument and protocol?

* I haven't done any root tissue grounding. Who has experience using that? 

* Can I use some of the foil lid for 96 well plates? And I can buy more lalter. As well as for the tips.

* Do you guys using filter tips or normal tips for DNA extraction?

* I will use 96 well plates kit and the tumbler.

* Can we use Power soil kit for Endosphere DNA extraction? If not, what does your lab use?
