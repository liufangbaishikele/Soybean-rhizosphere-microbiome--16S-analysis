### For this experiment, soybean bulk, rhizosphere and endosphere microbes were characterized based on 16S rRNA V3-V4 sequencing data. MOTHUR was used to process the sequencing data to generate community abundance dataframe. R packages and Python based softwares were used to analyze bacteria abundance data.
