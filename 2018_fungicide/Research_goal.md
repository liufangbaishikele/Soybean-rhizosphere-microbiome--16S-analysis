## Research goal for fungicide treatment experiment

1. Fungicide Seed treatment

* We want to investigate how seed-born microbe would impact the establishment of endosphere and rhizosphere microbiome assembly.

* How fungicide would mediate this assembly process.


2. Foliar spraying of fungicide

* We want to evaluate how the foliar fungicide treatment will impact native soil microbial community. It will help us to evaluate the potential impacts of the application of specific fungicide on native microbe diversity or related to the health of soil ecology in terms of microbiota diversity.
