### What is ITS? 

*ITS efers to the spacer DNA situated between the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and large-subunit rRNA genes in the chromosome*

### Primer sets

For ITS sequencing we targeted ITS2 region with customized primer sets composed of a mixture of 6 forward and 2 reverse primers designed to detect as much diverse taxa as possible- refer to this paper for detaield information (The Populus holobiont: dissecting the effects of plant niches and genotype on the microbiome)[https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-018-0413-8].
