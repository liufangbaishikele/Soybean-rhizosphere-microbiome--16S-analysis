## Gene selection and hairy root transformation


**Select genes as target for build over-expression construct**

* Collect information and download sequence of genes involved in strigolactone biosynthesis and signaling. TAIR for Arabidopsis thaliana, and corresponding orthologs in Glycine max are infered.
* Download mRNA sequence for all strigolactone biosynthesis and signaling genes from SoyBase.
* Design primers for qRT-PCR use Primer3 based on multi-alignment results.
  1. Primer length 21-23bp
  2. At least three G/C at the last 5 bp at the 3' end of the designed primer
  3. Melting temperature 59-62 celsius.
* Extract RNA from soybean root and do DNAase treatment to remove DNA contaminants.
* One-step qRT-PCR (using Power SYBR® Green RNA-to-CT™ 1-Step Kit) with ubiquitin gene as control and water as negative control.
* Based on delta CT (cycle threhold) - the higher the Ct value the low the expression. Here ubiquitin is used as innerstandard.
* Three genes are selected as the targets for over-expression contructs: the highly expressed homologs of Max1, D14 and Max2 genes were selected (i.e., Glyma.14g096900 , Glyma.17g235300 and Glyma.12g128600) as targets for subsequent expression manipulation.

**Gene clone and hairy root transformation**

* Amplify cDNA from mRNA samples using oligoT and M-MLV reverse transcriptase.
* The amplified cDNA were subsequently used as template for amplify the coding sequence of selected genes. Durint this PCR process, both restriction enzyme cutting sequence and TATA box were added to the PCR products.
